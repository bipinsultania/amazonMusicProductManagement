I am glad to share that I have graduated from Udacityâ€™s Product Management Nanodegree program. It has been a great learning journey for the last 4 months. I started with a basic knowledge of the roles of a PM. But now, I can say that I understand the various organizational functions and how multidisciplinary the field is.

Through the program, I learned to:
    1. Pitch a product vision
    2. Run a design sprint
    3. Manage a product development process
    4. And, to launch the product
